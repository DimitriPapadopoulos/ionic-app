# Node.js 14

The Ionic version used in this project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14,
because it has a dependency on a version node-sass that doesn't work on Node.js 16 (latest LTS).

Node.js 14 is still supported until 2023.

You can download Node.js from the following URL:

https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/


## Installation on MacOS

	sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules
	sudo tar vzxf node-v14.18.1-darwin-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/ --strip-components 1

*(note: the version number of the latest version of Node.js may have changed, update the command line accordingly)*
