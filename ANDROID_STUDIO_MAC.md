# Setting up Android Studio on Mac OS

The procedure for setting up Android Studio on MacOS is a bit confusing.
Use these steps to get it working.

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

2. Start Android Studio, choose to not import settings if you are asked about this

3. During the installation wizard, set things up with the default settings

4. Preferences (âŒ˜,) and search for SDK. At the time of writing, it's under **Appearance & Behavior** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK**

5. Make sure **Android SDK Command-line Tools** is installed (under **SDK Tools**)

6. Accept licenses

		JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home" ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses

7. Run `make open-android`

*or follow the [building instructions](DEV_ANDROID.md) for manual building*
